/**
 * Homepage A/B Test Variants
 *
 * Each variant swaps ONLY the hero section text content.
 * Nothing below the hero changes — buttons, flows, CTAs, upload zones stay identical.
 *
 * To add a new variant: add an entry here. The hook handles assignment automatically.
 * To force a variant for review: append ?v=KEY to the URL (e.g., ?v=loss_aversion)
 *   NOTE: URL overrides are session-only — they do NOT persist to localStorage.
 * To disable A/B testing: set ACTIVE_VARIANTS to a single-element array.
